Apache Flex (Flex) Binary Distribution
======================================

The source for the framework is included in the binary distribution.  It can be useful
if you wish to debug and/or extend components.

Use ../README to complete the "Install Prerequisites" and "FlashPlayer Configuration".

Building the Framework
----------------------

    When you have all the prerequisites in place and the environment variables set, use

        ant main        (or just ant since the default target is main)
    
    to download the thirdparty dependencies and build the Flex framework.  Since the 
    thirdparty dependencies take a little while to download and they don't change very 
    often, they are not cleaned with the regular clean target.  The thirdparty 
    dependencies can be found in the "in" directory.
    
    To clean the build, of everything other than the downloaded third-party dependencies 
    use
    
        ant clean 
    
    To clean the build, of everything, including the downloaded third-party dependencies 
    use
        
        ant super-clean (which is just thirdparty-clean followed by clean)
