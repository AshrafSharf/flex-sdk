    <h1>Apache Flex (incubating)</h1>
    <div>
        This is an ugly temporary website for the Apache Flex podling - stay tuned for more info.
    </div>

    <h2>Mailing lists</h2>
    <div>
        For now, you can join the Flex developer's mailing list by sending an email
        to <code>flex-dev-subscribe (at) incubator.apache.org</code> - this is where <em>everything</em>
        related to this project is being discussed.
    </div>
    <div>
        Once subscribed, send messages to <code>flex-dev (at) incubator.apache.org</code>.
    </div>
    <div>
        In addition to the dev list, active developers should subscribe to the <code>-commits</code>
        list.
    </div>

    <h2>Apache accounts</h2>
    <div>
       If you're a committer for the Flex podling (listed in the podling's incubation proposal, see below),
       your <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt">iCLA</a> has been filed
       and you don't have an @apache.org account yet, please send an email to <code>flex-dev (at) incubator.apache.org</code>
       with [ACCOUNT] in the subject line, indicating what Apache ID you'd like us to use for creating
       your account. See <a href="http://people.apache.org/committer-index.html">http://people.apache.org/committer-index.html</a>
       for existing IDs, and choose one that's not in use yet.
    </div>

    <h2>Guide for new committers</h2>
    <div>
      If you're a new Apache committer, please read at least the <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/new-committers-guide.html">guide for 
      new committers</a>. Other content from <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev">www.apache.org/dev</a> can be useful as well.
