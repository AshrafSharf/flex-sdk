    Apache Flex is a large project with many pieces.  The framework is implemented
    in Actionscript and the compiler is implemented in Java.

    Currently supported platforms include:

        Microsoft Windows
        Mac OS X
        Apple iOS
        Google Android
        RIM BlackBerry

    Apache Flex is the software evolution of the popular Adobe Flex SDK project.
    
    The community surrounding Flex is vast, diverse, distributed globally, and with all 
    levels of proficiency in software development. It is estimated that there are between 
    350,000 and 500,000 Flex developers worldwide. 

Getting the latest sources via Subversion
=========================================

    You can always checkout the latest source via subversion using the following
    command:

Building Apache Flex
====================

    Apache Flex is a large project and depends on several external libraries which
    are downloaded as part of the build process.
    
    Before building Flex you must install:
        Java SDK 1.5.0_13 or greater
        Ant 1.7.0 or greater

    The following environment variables must be set:
    
        JAVA_HOME
        ANT_HOME

    The PATH must include
    
        bin directory of Flex SDK
        bin directory of Ant
        bin directory of Java
    
    For testing, the Flash Player's mm.cfg file must have the following entries
    
        ErrorReportingEnable=1
        TraceOutputFileEnable=1
    
    and a FlashPlayerTrust file must allow local SWFs to access local files.

    With having all prerequisites in place, you can simply run

        cd <top-level-flex-directory>
        ant [main] (the default target is main)
    
        or
        
        ant release
    
    To generate a source distro, build the sources, and generate a binary-distro.
    The output distros can be found in the out subdirectory.
    
    To clean the build, of everything other than the downloaded third-party code use
    
        ant clean 
    
    To clean the build, of everything, including than the downloaded third-party code use
        
        ant super-clean
