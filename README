    Apache Flex is the software evolution of the popular Adobe Flex SDK project.
    
    The community surrounding Flex is vast, diverse, distributed globally, and with all 
    levels of proficiency in software development. It is estimated that there are between 
    350,000 and 500,000 Flex developers worldwide.

Building Apache Flex
====================

    Apache Flex is a large project and depends on several external libraries which
    are downloaded as part of the build process.
    
Building Apache Flex 4.8.0
==========================

    Apache Flex is a large project. It requires some build tools which must be installed
    prior to building Flex and it depends on some external libraries which
    are downloaded as part of the build process.
    
    Apache Flex 4.8.0 is a parity release from Apache of Adobe Flex 4.6.
    
Install Prerequisites
---------------------

    Before building Flex you must install the following software and set the
    corresponding environment variables using absolute file paths.  Relative file paths
    will result in build errors. 
    
    Alternatively, PLAYERGLOBAL_HOME, AIR_HOME and FLASHPLAYER_DEBUGGER may be set in 
    env.properties located in the top-level directory.

    ==================================================================================
    SOFTWARE                                    ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE (absolute paths)
    ==================================================================================
    
    Java SDK 1.5 (0_13 or greater)              JAVA_HOME
    or Java SDK 1.6
    
    Ant 1.7.0 or greater                        ANT_HOME
    
    Cygwin, git bash 
    or other unix-like shell
    (if Windows)
    
    Adobe Flash Player                          PLAYERGLOBAL_HOME
    (rename playerglobal11_1.swc to 
    playerglobal.swc and point to this file)
    
    Adobe AIR Integration Kit                   AIR_HOME 
    (unzip and point to 'AIR Integration Kit' 
    directory)
    
    Adobe Flash Player Content Debugger         FLASHPLAYER_DEBUGGER
    (windows) point to FlashPlayerDebugger.exe
    (mac) point to Flash Player Debugger in Flash Player Debugger.app/Contents/MacOS
    (linux) point to flashplayerdebugger
    
    ==================================================================================

    Adobe Flex 4.6 was certified with AIR 3.1 and Flash Player 11.1.
         
    The Adobe AIR integration kit for Windows can be downloaded from:
        http://airdownload.adobe.com/air/win/download/3.1/AdobeAIRSDK.zip
        
    The Adobe AIR integration kit for Mac can be downloaded from:
        http://airdownload.adobe.com/air/mac/download/3.1/AdobeAIRSDK.tbz2
        
    The Adobe Flash Player playerglobal.swc for 11.1 can be downloaded from:
        http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/updaters/11/playerglobal11_1.swc 
    
    The Adobe Flash Player content debuggers can be found here:
        http://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/downloads.html
        
    For testing, the Flash Player's mm.cfg file must have the following entries
    
        ErrorReportingEnable=1
        TraceOutputFileEnable=1
    
    and a FlashPlayerTrust file must allow local SWFs to access local files.

Building the Source
-------------------

    When you have all the prerequisites in place and the environment variables set, use

        cd <flex.dir>
        ant main        (or just ant since the default target is main)
    
    to download the thirdparty dependencies and build all the sources.  Since the thirdparty
    dependencies take a little while to download and they don't change very often, they are not
    cleaned with the regular clean target.  They thirdparty dependencies be found in the "in" 
    directory.
    
    To clean the build, of everything other than the downloaded third-party dependencies use
    
        ant clean 
    
    To clean the build, of everything, including the downloaded third-party dependencies use
        
        ant super-clean (which is just thirdparty-clean followed by clean)
        
    To generate a source distro and a binary distro use
        
        ant release
    
    The output distros can be found in the "out" subdirectory.
    
    To download the dependencies use
    
        ant thirdparty-downloads
            
    To clean the build ofjust the downloaded third-party dependencies use
    
        ant thirdparty-clean
        
    To get a brief listing of all the targets type
    
        ant help
