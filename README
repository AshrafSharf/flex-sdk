Apache Flex (Flex)
==================

    Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based applications 
    for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.
    
    For detailed information about Apache Flex please visit 
    http://incubator.apache.org/flex/

    Apache Flex is a large project with many pieces.  The framework is implemented
    in Actionscript and the compiler is implemented in Java.

    Currently supported platforms include:

        Microsoft Windows
        Mac OS X
        Apple iOS
        Google Android
        RIM BlackBerry

    Apache Flex is the software evolution of the popular Adobe Flex SDK project.
    
    The community surrounding Flex is vast, diverse, distributed globally, and with all 
    levels of proficiency in software development. It is estimated that there are between 
    350,000 and 500,000 Flex developers worldwide. 

Getting the latest sources via Subversion
=========================================

    You can always checkout the latest source via subversion using the following
    command:

    svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/flex/trunk flex

Building Apache Flex
====================

    Apache Flex is a large project and depends on several external libraries which
    are downloaded as part of the build process.
    
Building Apache Flex 4.8
========================

    Apache Flex 4.8 is a parity release from Apache of Adobe Flex 4.6.
    
    Apache Flex is a large project. It requires some build tools which must be installed
    prior to building Flex and it depends on some external libraries which
    are downloaded as part of the build process.
    
    From Apache's perspective, the Adobe Flash Player and Adobe AIR have excluded
    licenses so they can not be bundled with the Apache Flex binaries.  They must be
    installed prior to building Apache Flex.
    
Install Prerequisites
---------------------

    Adobe Flex 4.6 was certified with AIR 3.1 and Flash Player 11.1.  Adobe Flex 4.8
    will continue to use these.

    Before building Flex you must install the following software and set the
    corresponding environment variables using absolute file paths.  Relative file paths
    will result in build errors.
	
	The environment variables PLAYERGLOBAL_HOME, AIR_HOME and FLASHPLAYER_DEBUGGER can
	also be set in a file. See the env-template.properties file for instructions.
    
    The Adobe Flash Player playerglobal.swc is needed to compile all the components
    with the exception of the airframework and airspark components which require
    airglobal.swc from the AIR Integration Kit.  The AIR Integration kit is also needed
    to build and debug mobile applications.  The Flash Player content debugger is
    used by checkintests and other pieces of the test subsystem to run compiled
    applications.

    *1) The Adobe AIR integration kit for Windows can be downloaded from:
                http://airdownload.adobe.com/air/win/download/3.1/AdobeAIRSDK.zip
        
         The Adobe AIR integration kit for Mac can be downloaded from:
            http://airdownload.adobe.com/air/mac/download/3.1/AdobeAIRSDK.tbz2
        
        Download the AIR SDK for your platform and unzip it.  Set AIR_HOME to the absolute 
        path of the AIR SDK directory.
               
    *2) The Adobe Flash Player content debuggers can be found here:
            http://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/downloads.html
            
        On Windows, set FLASHPLAYER_DEBUGGER to the absolute path of FlashPlayerDebugger.exe
        
        On the Mac, set FLASHPLAYER_DEBUGGER to the absolute path of 
        Flash Player Debugger.app/Contents/MacOS/Flash Player Debugger
        
        On Linux, set set FLASHPLAYER_DEBUGGER to the absolute path of flashplayerdebugger
            
    *3) The Adobe Flash Player playerglobal.swc for 11.1 can be downloaded from:
            http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/updaters/11/playerglobal11_1.swc

        Set PLAYERGLOBAL_HOME to the absolute path of the player directory (not including the
		version subdirectory). The target-version option controls which PLAYERGLOBAL_HOME
		subdirectory is used.

	PIXELBENDER_HOME to the absolute path of the AIR SDK directory.

FlashPlayer Configuration
-------------------------

    For testing, the Flash Player's mm.cfg file must have the following entries
    
        ErrorReportingEnable=1
        TraceOutputFileEnable=1
    
    and a FlashPlayerTrust file must allow local SWFs to access local files.

Building the Source
-------------------

    When you have all the prerequisites in place and the environment variables set, use

        cd <flex.dir>
        ant main        (or just ant since the default target is main)
    
    to download the thirdparty dependencies and build the source.  Since the 
    thirdparty dependencies take a little while to download and they don't change very 
    often, they are not cleaned with the regular clean target.  The thirdparty 
    dependencies can be found in the "in" directory.
    
    To clean the build, of everything other than the downloaded third-party dependencies 
    use
    
        ant clean 
    
    To clean the build, of everything, including the downloaded third-party dependencies 
    use
        
        ant super-clean (which is just thirdparty-clean followed by clean)
        
    To generate a source distro and a binary distro use
        
        ant release
    
    The output distros can be found in the "out" subdirectory.
            
    To get a brief listing of all the targets type
    
        ant -projecthelp
